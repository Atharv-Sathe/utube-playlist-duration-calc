### **Coding Guidelines**

To maintain code quality and consistency, please adhere to these guidelines:

  * **Modularity**: Write code in a modular fashion. Break down large files or functions into smaller, reusable components.
  * **Best Practices**: Follow JavaScript best practices. Use modern ES6+ syntax where appropriate.
  * **Documentation**:
      * Document all functions, classes, and complex code blocks using JSDoc-style comments.
      * Explain the purpose, parameters, and return values of functions.
  * **Manifest.json**: Changes to `manifest.json` should be clearly explained in your pull request.
  * **Content Script**: Ensure your content script is well-contained and doesn't interfere with the host page's functionality unnecessarily.
