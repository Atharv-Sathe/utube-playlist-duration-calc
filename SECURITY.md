### **Security Policy**

We take the security of this project seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you find.

### **Supported Versions**

Given the small size and nature of this project, we only support the **latest stable version** with security updates. If you are using an older version, please update to the latest release to ensure you have the most recent security patches.

### **Reporting a Vulnerability**

We encourage you to report security vulnerabilities to us as soon as you find them.

#### **How to Report**
To report a security vulnerability, please email the project maintainer directly at **athsat.work@gmail.com**.

* Please include a clear description of the vulnerability.
* Provide a way to reproduce the vulnerability (e.g., step-by-step instructions, a code snippet, or a link to a proof-of-concept).
* Any additional information that could help in understanding and fixing the issue is appreciated.

#### **Our Promise**
We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and provide an estimated timeline for a fix. We will keep you updated on our progress and will credit you for the discovery in the release notes, if you wish. We kindly ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it.

Thank you for helping us keep this project secure.
